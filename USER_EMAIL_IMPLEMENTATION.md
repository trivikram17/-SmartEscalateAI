# ‚úÖ User Email Implementation - Complete

## üéØ What Was Implemented

Your Smart Escalate AI system now **sends ticket emails FROM the user's email address**, not from a system email. This means:

1. **User's Email as Sender**: When a ticket is generated, the email to the company appears to come from the user
2. **Direct Responses**: Companies will reply directly to the user's inbox (not to a system email)
3. **Better Support**: Companies are more likely to respond when they can reply directly to the customer

---

## üîÑ How It Works

### User Flow:

1. **User logs in** with their email address (or signs up)
2. **Email is stored** in localStorage automatically
3. **User starts chatting** with the AI about an issue (e.g., "My Airtel internet is not working")
4. **AI detects the company** (Airtel, Jio, Amazon, etc.)
5. **User requests ticket** or AI suggests escalation
6. **AI generates ticket** using the logged-in user's email (no need to ask!)
7. **Email is sent** to company's customer care (e.g., care@airtel.in)
8. **Company receives email FROM user's address** (from login)
9. **Company replies directly** to the user's inbox

**Key Advantage**: Since users must log in, their email is always available. No need to ask for it during chat!

## üìß Email Template Configuration

When you set up the EmailJS template, make sure to include these variables:

### Required Template Variables:

```
{{to_email}}         - Company's customer care email (e.g., care@airtel.in)
{{from_name}}        - User's name (e.g., "John Doe")
{{from_email}}       - User's email address (e.g., john@example.com)
{{reply_to}}         - User's email (same as from_email, for replies)
{{ticket_number}}    - Generated ticket ID (e.g., TKT-123456)
{{subject}}          - Main issue summary
{{priority}}         - URGENT, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
{{category}}         - Issue category
{{company}}          - Detected company name
{{chat_summary}}     - Complete conversation history
{{created_at}}       - Timestamp
```

### EmailJS Template Settings:

**Important:** In your EmailJS template settings, configure:

- **To Email**: `{{to_email}}` (this is the company's customer care email)
- **From Name**: `{{from_name}}` (user's name)
- **From Email**: Use your verified EmailJS sender email
- **Reply-To**: `{{reply_to}}` (user's email - so companies reply to user)

> **Note:** EmailJS requires a verified sender email, but the `Reply-To` field ensures companies respond directly to the user.

## üíª Code Implementation

### User Email from Login:

The system retrieves the user's email from localStorage (set during login):

```typescript
export function useChatBot() {
  // Get user info from localStorage (set during login)
  const loggedInUserEmail = localStorage.getItem("userEmail") || "";
  const loggedInUserName = localStorage.getItem("userName") || "";

  const [state, setState] = useState<ChatState>({
    // ... other state
    conversationContext: {
      attemptCount: 0,
      userEmail: loggedInUserEmail, // Always available from login
      userName: loggedInUserName,   // Always available from login
    },
  });
}
```

### Login System:

When users log in or sign up, their information is stored:

```typescript
// Login
localStorage.setItem("userEmail", email);
localStorage.setItem("userName", name);

// Guest mode (optional)
localStorage.setItem("userEmail", "guest@smartescalate.ai");
localStorage.setItem("userName", "Guest User");
```

### Email Sending (sendTicketEmail function):

```typescript
await emailjs.send(
  serviceId,
  templateId,
  {
    to_email: recipientEmail,              // Company's customer care email
    from_name: context.userName || "User",  // User's name
    from_email: context.userEmail,          // User's email address
    reply_to: context.userEmail,            // User's email (for replies)
    ticket_number: ticket.ticketNumber,
    subject: context.mainIssue,
    priority: ticket.priority.toUpperCase(),
    category: ticket.category,
    company: context.detectedCompany,
    chat_summary: chatSummary,
    created_at: ticket.createdAt.toLocaleString(),
  },
  publicKey
);
```

## üè¢ Supported Companies

The system automatically routes emails to these companies:

| Company | Email Address |
|---------|---------------|
| Airtel | care@airtel.in |
| Jio | care@jio.com |
| BSNL | customercare@bsnl.in |
| Vi (Vodafone Idea) | customercare@myvi.in |
| Amazon | cs-reply@amazon.in |
| Flipkart | support@flipkart.com |
| Swiggy | support@swiggy.in |
| Zomato | support@zomato.com |
| Ola | support@olacabs.com |
| Uber | support@uber.com |
| PayTM | care@paytm.com |
| PhonePe | support@phonepe.com |
| GooglePay | support-in@google.com |

*More companies can be added easily in the `companyEmails` object in `useChatBot.ts`*

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **User email collected during login/signup** - standard authentication flow
- **Stored in localStorage** for session persistence
- **EmailJS handles the email sending** securely from the frontend
- **No backend required** - everything works client-side
- **User controls their data** - can log out to clear localStorage
- **Guest mode available** - uses guest@smartescalate.ai for non-logged-in users

---

## üß™ Testing Steps

1. **Go to Login page**: `/login`
2. **Sign up** with: name="Test User", email="test@example.com", password="test123"
3. **Login successful**: Redirected to homepage
4. **Start a chat**: "My Jio connection is slow"
5. **AI detects company**: Jio
6. **Request ticket**: "Can you escalate this?"
7. **Ticket generated**: Email sent to care@jio.com FROM test@example.com (no email asked!)
8. **Check inbox**: Company replies will come directly to test@example.com

**Note**: The system automatically uses the email from your login - no need to type it again!

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Get EmailJS Credentials**:
   - Follow `EMAILJS_SETUP.md` to create account
   - Copy Service ID, Template ID, and Public Key
   - Add to `.env` file

2. **Configure Email Template**:
   - Use the HTML template from `TICKET_EMAIL_SETUP.md`
   - Add all template variables listed above
   - Set Reply-To to `{{reply_to}}`

3. **Test the System**:
   - Start development server: `npm run dev`
   - Chat with the AI about an issue
   - Provide your email when asked
