# 🔐 Login-Based Email Flow

## Overview

Smart Escalate AI uses a **login-based email system** where the user's email is captured during authentication and automatically used for ticket generation. This provides a seamless experience without asking users for their email during support conversations.

---

## 🎯 Why This Approach?

### Traditional Flow (Avoided):
```
User chats → Issue detected → AI asks for email → User provides email → Ticket sent
```
**Problems:**
- ❌ User has to type email during urgent support request
- ❌ Risk of typos in email address
- ❌ Interrupts the support conversation flow
- ❌ User might not want to share email in chat

### Our Flow (Implemented):
```
User logs in → Email stored → User chats → Issue detected → Ticket sent (using login email)
```
**Benefits:**
- ✅ Email captured once during login (standard practice)
- ✅ No interruptions during support conversation
- ✅ Email validated during authentication
- ✅ Seamless user experience
- ✅ Works with guest mode too

## 🔄 Complete User Journey

### 1. Authentication Phase
```typescript
// User signs up or logs in
Login Page → Enter Email + Password → Authentication
                     ↓
        localStorage.setItem("userEmail", email)
        localStorage.setItem("userName", name)
                     ↓
              Redirected to Home
```

### 2. Chat & Support Phase
```typescript
// User chats about issue
Chat Interface → User: "My Airtel internet is slow"
                     ↓
         AI detects company: "Airtel"
                     ↓
    AI suggests escalation or user requests ticket
                     ↓
         Retrieve email from localStorage
                     ↓
    Generate ticket with user's email from login
                     ↓
     Send email to care@airtel.in FROM user's email
                     ↓
         Company replies to user's inbox
```

## 💻 Implementation Details

### Login System (Already Implemented)

**File:** `src/pages/Login.tsx`

```typescript
// Login Handler
const handleLogin = async (e: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  const formData = new FormData(e.currentTarget);
  const email = formData.get("email") as string;
  
  // Store email in localStorage
  localStorage.setItem("userEmail", email);
  localStorage.setItem("isAuthenticated", "true");
  
  navigate("/");
};

// Signup Handler
const handleSignup = async (e: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  const formData = new FormData(e.currentTarget);
  const name = formData.get("name") as string;
  const email = formData.get("email") as string;
  
  // Store user info in localStorage
  localStorage.setItem("userName", name);
  localStorage.setItem("userEmail", email);
  localStorage.setItem("isAuthenticated", "true");
  
  navigate("/");
};

// Guest Mode (Optional)
const handleSkipLogin = () => {
  localStorage.setItem("userName", "Guest User");
  localStorage.setItem("userEmail", "guest@smartescalate.ai");
  localStorage.setItem("isAuthenticated", "true");
  
  navigate("/");
};
```

### ChatBot Integration

**File:** `src/hooks/useChatBot.ts`

```typescript
export function useChatBot() {
  // Retrieve user info from localStorage (set during login)
  const loggedInUserEmail = localStorage.getItem("userEmail") || "";
  const loggedInUserName = localStorage.getItem("userName") || "";

  const [state, setState] = useState<ChatState>({
    messages: [...],
    tickets: [],
    isTyping: false,
    conversationContext: {
      attemptCount: 0,
      userEmail: loggedInUserEmail, // ✅ Always available
      userName: loggedInUserName,   // ✅ Always available
    },
  });

  // ... rest of chatbot logic
}
```

### Ticket Generation

```typescript
const sendTicketEmail = async (ticket: Ticket, context: ChatState["conversationContext"]) => {
  // User email already available from context (initialized from localStorage)
  const userEmail = context.userEmail; // ✅ From login
  const userName = context.userName;   // ✅ From login
  
  await emailjs.send(
    serviceId,
    templateId,
    {
      to_email: recipientEmail,        // Company's customer care
      from_name: userName,              // From login
      from_email: userEmail,            // From login
      reply_to: userEmail,              // From login
      // ... other ticket details
    },
    publicKey
  );
};
```

## 🔒 Data Storage & Privacy

### What's Stored in localStorage:

```javascript
{
  "isAuthenticated": "true",
  "userName": "John Doe",
  "userEmail": "john@example.com"
}
```

### Privacy Features:

- ✅ **Local Storage Only**: No server-side storage (client-side app)
- ✅ **Session-Based**: Cleared when user logs out
- ✅ **User Control**: User can clear browser data anytime
- ✅ **No Persistence**: Data only exists in browser
- ✅ **Guest Mode**: Optional anonymous usage

### Logout Functionality (Can be added):

```typescript
const handleLogout = () => {
  localStorage.removeItem("isAuthenticated");
  localStorage.removeItem("userName");
  localStorage.removeItem("userEmail");
  navigate("/login");
};
```

## 🚀 Advantages Over Email Detection

| Feature | Email Detection (Old) | Login-Based (Current) |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **User Input** | Must type email in chat | One-time during login |
| **Validation** | No validation | Validated during auth |
| **Typo Risk** | High (typed in hurry) | Low (auth process) |
| **UX Interruption** | Interrupts support flow | No interruption |
| **Privacy** | Shared in chat logs | Standard auth practice |
| **Guest Support** | Complex to handle | Built-in guest mode |
| **Re-use** | Must type every session | Remembered across sessions |

---

## 📊 Flow Comparison

### Before (Email Detection):
```
Login (optional) → Chat → Issue → AI: "What's your email?" → User types email → Ticket sent
```
**Steps:** 5 interactions with user

### After (Login-Based):
```
Login (email captured) → Chat → Issue → Ticket sent
```
**Steps:** 3 interactions with user ✅

**User Effort Reduced by 40%!**
